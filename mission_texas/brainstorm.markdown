## Purpose

The city of Mission, TX seeks to incubate a technology community to propel the
economic and social growth of the local community. To begin that growth, we will recruit, select, and train a group of software developers who will agree to live and work in Mission as they build software and software-based businesses.

### Part 2: Introductory Sessions
